# Aqtis Solidity Challenge

Let's start with a new Hardhat project, which gives me some guidelines already. 
I guess there are two ways to interpret token distribution, either fully on-contract, or let the backend script decide.. Or maybe some way in-between. Let's write the basic token contracts and vault for now, after that I'll figure out how to implement the airdrop.

Log: 28 may 21:00 - 21:50 Added basic token things - Airvault deposit/withdraw. Next up: Some tests!
